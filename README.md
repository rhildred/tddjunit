#Test Driven Development

Did I mention that I had a programmer's crush on Kent Beck? The coolest thing that Beck did in my opinion is test drive development and Beck has done some pretty cool things with software methods. The thing that I love about test driven development is that it helps get past procrastination. I am not saying that all software people are procrastinators, but we probably all know someone that is.
